# Self Adaptive User Interface(SAUI)

## Installation:
The project does not need any installation to run if you have a browser in your system. Just run the index.html to run the application.
## Overview:
Purpose of the project is to implement **SAUI**. For this to achieve, mis-click and rating will be measured while a user is using the application. Then using the **Bayes Theorem** the changing in UI will be calculated. By changing the UI means increase or decrease of text size or icon size.

Each time user will be using the application it automatically stores the measured data in **Local Storage**. In example, if a user runs the project at first it will fetch data from Local Storage and after using the application while closing it will be updated the data in Local Storage.
